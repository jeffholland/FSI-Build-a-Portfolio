    <h3>My Projects</h3>
    <p>Here is a demonstration of my thesis project for the Music Technology Master's program at NYU: 
      a computer music interface developed in C++ using the JUCE library. 
      The project is based on connecting objects known as "modules" in order to produce sounds.
      The goal is to create an environment of high flexibility, a kind of free-reign music creation sandbox.

    <p>Here is a demonstration of one of my music projects: an "unstable drum machine" developed in Pure Data (Pd). "Unstable" means that certain random variables affect parameters such as the speed/pitch of sample playback, the length of each note, and the sample selection itself.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I first came into software development through music, wanting to create my own tools for musical expression through code. 
      Currently, I develop applications in Python and C++. I also do front-end web development, of which this site is an example.
      I am always interested in new forms of human expression through technology.
